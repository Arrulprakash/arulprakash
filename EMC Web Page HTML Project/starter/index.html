    <li>CHENNAI: Presidency College has been ranked the third best college in the country in the NIRF rankings 2022, four rungs up from its seventh rank last year. The college now stands only after Miranda House College and Hindu College in Delhi.</li>
   <h1></h1>
    <li>This is a major achievement for any college in the State and especially so for Presidency, which, until a few years ago, was notorious for student clashes. Meticulous planning and dedicated efforts of staff helped the 182-year-old college, which produced a long list of illustrious alumni including Nobel laureates Sir CV Raman and S Chandrasekhar, regain some of its lost glory.</li>
    <h1></h1>
    <Li>College officials said a dedicated roadmap was chalked out last year to improve the ranking of the institution. “Over the last year, at least 60 committees were formed to supervise and ensure overall growth of the institution,” said R Raman, principal of the college.</Li>
    <h1></h1>
    <li>Besides, a special strategy was chalked out to improve the perception of the college. All 21 undergraduate (UG) and 21 postgraduate departments were directed to conduct seminars and workshops by engaging academicians of national repute. The efforts yielded the desired results as Presidency scored 70.23 out of 100 in the perception category.</li>
    <h1></h1>
    <li>“Every week, the college organises not fewer than 60 seminars and this helps us spread the legacy of Presidency College across the country. Our score in the perception parameter increased by almost 10 points in comparison with the previous year,” said Raman. The college plans to organise one international seminar per month in each department.</li>
    <h1></h1>
    <li>Improved research output and paper publications by faculty members, along with the impressive campus placements, also helped the college put up an impressive performance. “Almost 80% of our students are placed after completion of the courses,” claimed college officials.</li>

    <li>Admission: Eligibility of the course is quite simple only 55% marks are needed in the science group in 12th standard and the application form is not provided offline. You can only apply online via tngasa a government website for all government colleges. The admission process i good and no problem can be faced but there is a simple issue of finding the places inside the campus and it is quite hard for us to know the place of the Admission process because for every department different places will be there for the admission.</li>
